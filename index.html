        <h2>Problem Statement: Finding Movies and Shows to Enjoy</h2>
        <p>Students struggle with finding movies to enjoy, especially with others on campus. 
          This app recommends movies and shows based on the ones you like, and also includes where to watch 
          them, reviews on each of them, and showing times. </p>

    <p>
      Our affinity diagram consists of five categories including basic features, advertising and marketing, platforms, feedback, and hurdles.
      These categories showcase some features we plan for our app to have, basic marketing plans, problems we will likely face, and much more. 
      Having this diagram allowed us to brainstorm and understand the goals of our app more.
